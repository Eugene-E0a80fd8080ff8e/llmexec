I am writing a llm agent "llmexec" that will serve as a shebang script for llm scripting.
For example, consider this script:
```
#!/usr/bin/env -S llmexec --model gpt-4.1

list all the files at current directory
```
or

```
#!/usr/bin/env -S llmexec --model gpt-4.1

resize all the images in current directory to fit 320x320.
save resized images as a.resized.jpg (for initial a.jpg)
```

I need a system prompt for llmexec which, given the request as a user input, would make me a python program doing exactly that
